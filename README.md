## How to set up

Connect to psql by entering the following into your terminal:
```
psql
```
Create the database you'll be using with the psql command:
```
CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
```
Connect to the database using the following psql command:
```
\c bookmark_manager;
```
Run the query saved in the file:
```
01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
```
To run the RSpec/PG tests, you'll need to create a database solely for testing. Enter the following into your terminal (admin will be replaced by your computers username.)
```
$> psql
admin=# CREATE DATABASE "bookmark_manager_test";
admin=# CREATE TABLE bookmarks(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, url VARCHAR(60));
```


As a user, so that I can revisit my favourite websites,
I would like to see a list of the bookmarks I've created.
